        "We start by defining the size of the game, such as `\"A4x4\"` for a 4x4 board. The game size determines the complexity and the number of possible moves at each stage.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Connection Setup\n",
        "\n",
        "To interact with the game environment, we establish a connection to a server using socket programming. The server coordinates the flow of the game by sending the initial game state and responding to the moves made by the AlphaZero agent.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Agent Gameplay Loop\n",
        "\n",
        "Once connected, the agent enters a gameplay loop where it alternates between making moves and receiving responses from the server. The agent uses its `make_move` function to decide on the best action based on the current game state. This function internally calls the `selfPlay` method of the AlphaZero algorithm, which simulates games to determine the most promising move.\n",
        "\n",
        "The moves are sent to the server in a specified format, and the server's responses are processed to update the game state. The agent continues this loop until a terminal state is reached, signified by an `\"END\"` message from the server, indicating either a win, loss, or draw.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Game Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "At the end of the game, the agent closes the socket connection and prints the outcome of the game. If the agent is the last one to make a valid move before the game ends, it declares victory.\n",
        "\n",
        "This setup provides a framework for developing and testing AI agents for turn-based strategy games. The AlphaZero agent's performance can be further improved by training the underlying neural network on a dataset of high-quality game states and moves.\n"
